 *    -- initialize TP_Task.{op,u,threadFcn} for each
 *       element in TP_ThreadPool->perThread[] you want to use;
 *    -- call tpThreadDispatch() to start up numThreads threads 
 *       (numThreads might be less than TP_ThreadPool.numThreads);
 *    -- possibly do some work in the main thread;
 *    -- call tpThreadFinish() to wait for all threads to
 *       complete;

 * The numPthreads argument here is the number of pthreads this object manages.

 * do all the work, then call this with numPthreads == n-1.
 * We allocate additional TP_ThreadPool.perThread per the specified
 * extraPerThreads. If that's zero then the size of the perThread array is 
 * numPthreads. Note we NEVER allocate any perThread data if numPthreads is 0.
