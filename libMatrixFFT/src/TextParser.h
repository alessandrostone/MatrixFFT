/*
 * TextParser operates on a block of text obtained from a file or directly
 * from the caller. It processes text one line at a time, maintaining a cursor
 * which at any given time is at one of three places:
 *
 * -- beginning of file
 * -- after a newline (which could be /n, /r/n, or /r)
 * -- end of file
 *
 * Caller obtains the "next line" of text via getLine(), which copies the
 * line of text (sans newline) into a caller-supplied buffer. The cursor is
 * at the next character after the newline on return. 
 * 
 * The parseLine() function parses one line of text into separate mallocd tokens 
 * which are separated in the line of input text by spaces (' ' or '\t').
 *
 * Alternatively, getTokens() combines the previous two operations, returning
 * all the tokens in the "next line" of text and advancing the cursor to the 
 * next character after the newline.
