 * Execute FFT for the specified MatrixFFTPlan.
 *
 * MEF_TRANSPOSE_xxx can be specified in the optFlags argument
 * to transpose data to/from the native format as required. 
 *
 * In the absence of MEF_TRANSPOSE_xxx flags, input is assumed to 
 * be in native format for input and will be in native
 * format on output. 
 *
 * If a transpose flag is set for an operation for which no transposition is 
 * required (e.g. the native input format to a forward FFT is in fact in 
 * row order), the transpose flag is ignored. 
 *
 * Note that in some configurations, the input buffer is overwritten
 * during the execution of this function.
 *
 * For real-signal FFTs, the real data is split into an FFTComplex in the 
 * same manner is with vDSP: the FFTComplex.real components take the even-index
 * real data, and the FFTComplex.imag components take the odd-index real data. 
 * When configured to use interleaved data (FFT_SPLIT_COMPLEX = 0 in
 * MatrifFFTConfig.h), real data will be in memory in normal sequential
 * order, and it's OK to (carefully) cast your FFTFloat* to a FFTComplex* for
 * this operation. 
 *
 * Buffers should be aligned to FFT_MEM_ALIGNMENT bytes for maximum performance. 
 *
 * The outputs of inverse FFTs have to be normalized in order to obtain the actual
 * time-domain data. Normalization involves dividing each element of the output
 * by some multiple of the total number of elements in the signal as described below. 
 * If you specify the MEF_NormOutput on the mfftExecute() call for the inverse FFT,
 * the library will perform the required normalization in a highly optimized manner. 
 * The MEF_NormOutput flag is ignored during forward FFTs. 
 *
 *
 * Notes on the data produced by mfftExecute()
 * -------------------------------------------
 *
 * When the output format of a forward FFT is in column order, that data can be transposed 
 * to normal row order during mfftExecute() via the MEF_TransposeOutput option flag, or 
 * separately using mfftTranspose(). Note that specifying e.g. the MEF_TransposeOutput
 * option flag on a forward FFT when the native output is in row order has no effect; 
 * there is no performance penalty in doing so. 
 *
 * For all real-signal FFTs, when the output of a forward FFT is described as being in "row 
 * order", the format of the data is the same as the format of the output of the corresponding
 * FFTs implemented in the vDSP library. These formats are described in the following
 * document:
 *      http://developer.apple.com/hardwaredrivers/ve/downloads/vDSP_Library.pdf
 *
 * See the sections entitled "Data Packing for Real FFTs" and "Scaling Fourier Transforms"
 * for details.
 *
 * Descriptions of the frequency-domain data (the output of the forward FFT) and the 
 * required normalization (for the output of the inverse FFT) follow. 
 * Note for 1-D FFTs, 'numRows' and 'numCols' refer to the internal representation of the 
 * data; these values can be obtained from mfftRectangle().
 *
 * 
 *   1-D complex
 *   ---------------------
 *   Forward output format : Row order, or column order with numRows and numCols 
 *                           swapped, depending on signal size and configuration.
 *   Inverse normalization : Requires normalization by 1/N where N is the total number of 
 *                           complex elements. Use the MEF_NormOutput flag to perform 
 *                           normalization during the mfftExecute() call.
 *
 *   2-D complex
 *   ---------------------
 *   Forward output format : Row order or column order, depending on signal size and 
 *                           configuration.  
 *   Inverse normalization : Requires normalization by 1/N where N is the total number of 
 *                           complex elements. Use the MEF_NormOutput flag to perform 
 *                           normalization during the mfftExecute() call.
 *
 *   1-D real signal
 *   ---------------------
 *   Forward output format : Row order, or column order with numRows and numCols 
 *                           swapped, depending on signal size and configuration.
 *   Inverse normalization : Requires normalization by 1/2N where N is the total number of 
 *                           real elements. Use the MEF_NormOutput flag to perform 
 *                           normalization during the mfftExecute() call.
 *
 *   2-D real signal
 *   ---------------------
 *   Forward output format : Row order or column order, depending on signal size and 
 *                           configuration. You can determine which format will obtain for 
 *                           a given plan via mfftNativeFormat(). Note that specifying e.g. 
 *                           the MEF_TransposeOutput option flag on a forward FFT when the 
 *                           native output is in row order has no effect; there is no 
 *                           performance penalty in doing so. 
 *   Inverse normalization : Requires normalization by 1/2N where N is the total number of 
 *                           real elements. Use the MEF_NormOutput flag to perform
