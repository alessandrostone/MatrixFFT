                        MatrixFFT 'C' sample code

This directory contains sample code illustrating how to use the MatrixFFT
package from standard ANSI 'C' code. Four types of FFTs are illustrated - 
1- and 2-dimension, complex and real-signal. There is one program for
each of these four types of FFT. 

To build all four examples, just type 'make' in the cExamples program. This
uses a standard GNU-style Makefile to build.


Installing libMatrixFFT
-----------------------

This sample code assumes that the libMatrixFFT binary and its associated headers
have been installed on your machine. To do this, use the xcodebuild command line 
program, run as root (or via sudo) in the root MatrixFFT directory, as follows:

  # /usr/bin/xcodebuild install DSTROOT=/
  
That places the MatrixFFT library binary in /usr/local/lib/libMatrixFFT.a and 
the associated public headers in /usr/local/include/libMatrixFFT/*.h.
